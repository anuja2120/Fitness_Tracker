# Fitness_Tracker

The provided project is a Java Swing application designed to serve as a health and fitness tracker. It consists of two main components: a login page and the fitness tracker itself. The login page allows users to enter their username and password before accessing the main functionality of the application. Upon successful login, users are presented with the fitness tracker interface. The tracker allows users to input various fitness-related data such as the number of steps taken, distance covered, activity type (e.g., walking, running, cycling), height, and weight. Based on this input, the application calculates and displays information such as the estimated calories burned and BMI (Body Mass Index). Additionally, users can export and load their activity history, providing a comprehensive record of their fitness journey. The application aims to provide users with a convenient tool for monitoring their physical activity and promoting a healthy lifestyle.
